# Epilogue

## Where to next?
- Parts of the SciPy Ecosystem we haven't covered
- Other books/websites/resources
- Conferences (and their recorded sessions - links)
- Online courses
- Mailing lists and other resources for libraries covered in the book

## Contributing to the SciPy ecosystem
Why contribute?
Promises from preface:
We will help you get started in GitHub land
Later in Elegant SciPy we will show you how to contribute your new skills to the GitHub-hosted projects that comprise most of the scientific Python ecosystem.

### Learning how to use Git and GitHub
If you are completely new to Git, we suggest you look at a beginner tutorial first (link - software carpentry http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
What you will need to know to contribute to an open source project using Git (although some of this you can pick up by doing it!)
- Basic Git commands: clone, add, commit, push, pull, branch.
- Git commands that will likely be useful (but are not essential to get started):
merge, rebase, cherry-pick.
- Common GitHub actions: forking, pull requests, issues.

Some resources for learning Git/GitHub:
- Huff/Scopatz, Effective Computation in Physics
- Other O'Reilly books on git/github/pull requests
- Online tutorials

### How to contribute to SciPy and related packages specifically (community rules?) and GitHub etiquette
- When and where to raise GitHub issues
- When to use pull requests

### Testing

## Open Science
Why do open science?
- Reminder about open source licenses (refer to introduction)
- Open data
- Open access and preprints
